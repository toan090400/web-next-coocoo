            Welcome to Coco (“Coco,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). These Terms of
            Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Coco
            website(s), our API, and any other software, tools, features, or
            functionalities provided on or in connection with our services;
            including without limitation using our services to view, explore,
            and create NFTs and use our tools, at your discretion, to connect
            directly with others to purchase, sell, or transfer NFTs on public
            blockchains (collectively, the “Service”). “NFT” in these Terms
            means a non-fungible token or similar digital item implemented on a
            blockchain (such as the Binance Smart Chain blockchain), which uses
            smart contracts to link to or otherwise be associated with certain
            content or data.
          </span>
          <span className="span-2">
            For purposes of these Terms, “user,” “you,” and “your” means you as
            the user of the Service. If you use the Service on behalf of a
            company or other entity, then “you” includes you and that entity,
            and you represent and warrant that (a) you are an authorized
            representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity
            to these Terms, and (b) you agree to these Terms on the entity’s
            behalf.

            SECTION 16 BELOW, THEY INCLUDE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND
            CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS) REQUIRE ANY
            DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE RESOLVED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION

            Coco is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, financial
            institution, or creditor. Coco provides a peer-to-peer web3 service
            that helps users discover and directly interact with each other and
            NFTs available on public blockchains. We do not have custody or
            control over the NFTs or blockchains you are interacting with, and
            we do not execute or effectuate purchases, transfers, or sales of
            NFTs. To use our Service, you must use a third-party wallet that
            allows you to engage in transactions on blockchains.
          </span>
          <span className="span-6">
            Coco is not party to any agreement between any users. You bear full
            responsibility for verifying the identity, legitimacy, and
            authenticity of NFTs that you purchase from third-party sellers
            using the Service and we make no claims about the identity,
            legitimacy, functionality, or authenticity of users or NFTs (and any
            content associated with such NFTs) visible on the Service.
          </span>
          <span className="span-7">
            Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need to
            provide additional terms for specific services (and such services
            are deemed part of the “Service” hereunder and shall also be subject
            to these Terms). Those additional terms and conditions, which are
            available with the relevant Service, then become part of your
            agreement with us if you use those services. In the event of a
            conflict between these Terms and any additional applicable terms we
            may provide for a specific service, such additional terms shall
            control for that specific Service.

          <span className="span-8">
            Coco reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time
            and in our sole discretion. If we make material changes to these
            Terms, we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of such
            changes, such as by providing notice through the Service or updating
            the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms. By
            continuing to access or use the Service, you confirm your acceptance
            of the revised Terms and all of the terms incorporated therein by
            reference effective as of the date these Terms are updated. It is
            your sole responsibility to review the Terms from time to time to
            view such changes and to ensure that you understand the terms and
            conditions that apply when you access or use the Service.

            <span className="span-9-1">Accessing the Service</span>
            Like much of web3, your blockchain address functions as your
            identity on Coco. Accordingly, you will need a blockchain address
            and a third-party wallet to access the Service. Your Account on the
            Service (“Account”) will be associated with your blockchain address;
            however, if you want to customize your Coco persona, you can add
            additional information, such as a profile picture, to your Account.
          </span>
          <span className="span-10">
            Your Account on Coco will be associated with your linked blockchain
            address and display the NFTs for that blockchain address (and, if
            applicable, any content associated with such NFTs). By using your
            wallet in connection with the Service, you agree that you are using
            that wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable
            provider of the wallet. Wallets are not operated by, maintained by,
            or affiliated with Coco, and Coco does not have custody or control
            over the contents of your wallet and has no ability to retrieve or
            transfer its contents. Coco accepts no responsibility for, or
            liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet and makes
            no representations or warranties regarding how the Service will
            operate with any specific wallet. You are solely responsible for
            keeping your wallet secure and you should never share your wallet
            credentials or seed phrase with anyone. If you discover an issue
            related to your wallet, please contact your wallet provider.
            Likewise, you are solely responsible for your Account and any
            associated wallet and we are not liable for any acts or omissions by
            you in connection with your Account or as a result of your Account
            or wallet being compromised. You agree to immediately notify us if
            you discover or otherwise suspect any security issues related to the
            Service or your Account (you can contact us at hello@coco.market).
          </span>
          <span className="span-11">
            You also represent and warrant that you will comply with all
            applicable laws (e.g., local, state, federal and other laws) when
            using the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, by using the
            Service, you represent and warrant that: (a) you are not located in
            a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo; and (b) you
            have not been identified as a Specially Designated National or
            placed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited, sanctioned, or
            restricted parties. If you access or use the Service outside the
            United States, you are solely responsible for ensuring that your
            access and use of the Service in such country, territory or
            jurisdiction does not violate any applicable laws.

          <span className="span-12">
            Coco may require you to provide additional information and documents
            in certain circumstances, such as at the request of any government
            authority, as any applicable law or regulation dictates, or to
            investigate a potential violation of these Terms. In such cases,
            Coco, in its sole discretion, may disable your Account and block
            your ability to access the Service until such additional information
            and documents are processed by Coco. If you do not provide complete
            and accurate information in response to such a request, Coco may
            refuse to restore your access to the Service.

            Your access and use of the Service may be interrupted from time to

            of the Service or other actions that Coco, in its sole discretion,
            may elect to take. We require all users to be at least 18 years old.
            If you are at least 13 years old but under 18 years old, you may
            only use Coco through a parent or guardian’s Account and with their

            As a peer-to-peer web3 service, Coco helps you explore NFTs created
            by third parties and interact with different blockchains. Coco does
            not make any representations or warranties about this third-party
            content visible through our Service, including any content
            associated with NFTs displayed on the Service, and you bear
            responsibility for verifying the legitimacy, authenticity, and
            legality of NFTs that you purchase from third-party sellers. We also
            cannot guarantee that any NFTs visible on Coco will always remain
            visible and/or available to be bought, sold, or transferred.
          </span>
          <span className="span-20">
            NFTs may be subject to terms directly between buyers and sellers
            with respect to the use of the NFT content and benefits associated
            with a given NFT (“Purchase Terms”). For example, when you click to
            get more details about any of the NFTs visible on Coco, you may
            notice a third-party link to the creator’s website. Such a website
            may include Purchase Terms governing the use of the NFT that you
            will be required to comply with. Coco is not a party to any such
            Purchase Terms, which are solely between the buyer and the seller.
            The buyer and seller are entirely responsible for communicating,
            promulgating, agreeing to, and enforcing Purchase Terms. You are
            solely responsible for reviewing such Purchase Terms.

            available content, data, information, services, applications, or
            materials from third parties (“Third-Party Materials”). When you
            click on a link to, or access and use, a Third-Party Website or
            Third-Party Application, though we may not warn you that you have
            left our Service, you are subject to the terms and conditions
            (including privacy policies) of another website or destination. Such
            Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications, and Third-Party
            Materials are not under the control of Coco, and may be “open”
            applications for which no recourse is possible. Coco is not
            responsible or liable for any Third-Party Websites, Third-Party
            Applications, and Third-Party Materials. Coco provides links to
            these Third-Party Websites and Third-Party Applications only as a

              you must send an email requesting arbitration and describing your
              claim to our registered agent at hello@coco.market. The
              arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative
              dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and
              counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and
              interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the
              Streamlined Arbitration Rules and the JAMS Consumer Minimum
              Standards then in effect; all other claims shall be subject to
              JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules
